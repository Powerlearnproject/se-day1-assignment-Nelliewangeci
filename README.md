Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic , diciplined and quantifiable approach to the development and operation of software. 
It is important as it helps address problems and better peoples lives and also it ensures reliable,secure,efficient and effective software critical in the technology industry

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Structured Programming Revolution(2960-1970s)-saw a shift from unstructured,diificultto understand or maintain and tangled code to more organized and maintainable code.
2. The Rise of Object Oriented programming(1980s-1990s)-emphasized on abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism allowing for more flexible and reusable code.
3. The Internet Age and Rise of Agile (1990s-present)-it challenged traditionall waterfall style for software development and emphasized on  iterative development , customer collaboration and responding to changes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gathering-software development team holds discussions with various stakeholders from problem domain to bring out as much information on requirements.
Feasibility study- analysis if the software can be made to achieve all the requirements of user and if there is a possibility of software being of no more use.
System analysis-understanding software product,limitations and learning system related problems.
System design- bringing the knowlledge of software analysis and requirement gathering to design the software product, flowcharts and pseudo codes etc are used here.
Coding-writing program code in the most suitable programing language and developing error free executable codes.
Testing-done to discover errors and remedieds for the errors.
Implementation- installing software on client's hardware, software product is tested for compatibility and adaptability.
Operation and maintenance- users are trained and given documentation on how to use the software and maintenance is done to fix bugs,address issues and add new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall suggest that all phases of the sdlc will function one after the other in a linear manner, best suited for projects with well defined requiremnts and when developers have already designed and developed similar software and are aware of all its domain.
Agile instead of following a linear plan it is iterative such that it breaks projects into small manageable iterations, best suited for projects with changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- responsible for designing, coding and testing software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer-responsible for ensuring the quality of software by testing and identifying bugs.
Project Manager- plans, organizes and manages the software development project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for coding , debbuging, and testng making the software development process efficient eg Visual studio, Code blocks and Eclipse.
VCS software tools that enable developers to track changes, collaborate and revert to previous versions ensuring code integrity and teamwork eg Git and Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with the ever changing technology, this can be overcome by continual learning and openness to new ideas.
Debbuging and troubleshooting can be time consuming, can be overcome by use of systematic  approaches to identiy root causes.
Meeting deadlines since projects often have tight deadlinetime managments, this can be overcome by efficient time managment and braking large projects into small manageable portions.
Communication and collaboration with team members, this can be overcome by actively participating in team discussions and clear communication.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit-testing individuals units or components of codes to identify and fix bugs.
Intergration-veryfing different components work together as intended.
System-testing the entire system to ensure it meet the initial requirement and functions.
Acceptance- involving end users to validate if the software meets needs and expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of creating the right instructions to get the AI to do what you want.
Importance in interacting with AI models includes;
-A well designed prompt guides the AI to the exact information one requires.
-A good prompt gets the results needed quickly without wasting time.
-A good prompt also reduces the chances of AI providing false information.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-Generate a code.
Improved prompt-Generate a python code that adds two numbers a and b and displays their output
The second prompt gives the AI a clear direction of the programming language and the function leading to more relevant outputs.
